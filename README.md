# Email Subsystem Database

This project includes the SQL scripts necessary to set up the `email_subsystem` MySQL database, which contains three tables: `checklist`, `inbox`, and `user_details`. These tables are designed to handle user data, email checklists, and inbox information. 

I created this during my high school years in 2021, when I first started learning Python and MySQL, which were my first programming languages. My goal was to build a Google Suite clone (Gmail, Google Drive) as a personal project. I aimed to implement email authentication and image upload functionality into the database, but I couldn't achieve that back then. As a result, if you try to use the photo upload option, the program exits. Please excuse my past self if the logic seems redundant ðŸ˜…

The `#Mail` and `$Forgotpwd` files are for the GUI and password reset options, respectively. I had to stop halfway due to upcoming exams, but I've uploaded them in case anyone wants to build upon them.

## How to Use

Once the database is set up, you can:

The tables are flexible and can be modified to suit additional requirements for email systems.
